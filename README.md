# Hs-Random-Deck-Generator


A Java/Python code that builds random decks for the virtual card game Hearthstone based on pre-determined criteria, 
which can be chosen by the user. The code reads information from a text file on what cards the user has, then outputs
a deck using a GUI.

The front-end is made entirely in Java, while the back-end is made entirely in Python
